## Game Overview
Orapa Mine is a deduction board game where one player acts as the **Director** of the mine, secretly placing colored mineral pieces on a grid. The other players are **Explorers** who must deduce the positions and colors of all minerals by shooting "elastic waves" through the mine and observing where they exit and what color they become.

## Components

### Physical Components
1. **2 Mine Boards** - 10 cells wide × 8 cells tall grid
2. **5 Screens** - Used by the Director to hide their mineral placement
3. **2 Sets of Minerals** - Tangram-shaped pieces in different colors
4. **Solution Sheets** - Grid with numbered/lettered edges for tracking waves

### Mineral Pieces (Tangram Shapes)
The game includes the following pieces (6 tangram pieces + 1 petroleum block):

1. **2 Large Triangles** (Isosceles right triangles)
   - Long side (hypotenuse): 4 cells
   - Height: 2 cells
   - Area: **4 cells** each
   - Alignment: Long side aligns with grid cells
   - Colors: 1× White, 1× Blue

2. **1 Medium Triangle** (Isosceles right triangle)
   - Short sides: 2 cells each
   - Area: **2 cells**
   - Alignment: Short side aligns with grid cells
   - Colors: 1× Yellow

3. **1 Small Triangle** (Isosceles right triangle)
   - Long side (hypotenuse): 2 cells
   - Height: 1 cell
   - Area: **1 cell**
   - Alignment: Long side aligns with grid cells

   - Special: Absorbs all light (wave dissipates)
   - Colors: 1× Black

**Total cells per complete set: 17 cells** (4+4+2+1+2+2+2)

### Mineral Colors
- **Red** - Reflects and adds red to the wave color
- **Blue** - Reflects and adds blue to the wave color
- **Yellow** - Reflects and adds yellow to the wave color
- **Transparent/White** - Reflects without changing wave color
- **Black (Petroleum)** - Absorbs the wave (wave dissipates, no exit)

## Grid Setup

### Grid Dimensions
- **Width**: 10 cells
- **Height**: 8 cells

### Edge Numbering/Lettering
The grid edges are labeled for shooting elastic waves:

- **Top edge**: Numbers 1-10 (10 positions, one per column)
- **Left edge**: Numbers 11-18 (8 positions, one per row)
- **Bottom edge**: Letters A-J (10 positions, one per column)
- **Right edge**: Letters K-R (8 positions, one per row)

### Tangram Piece Placement
- Pieces align with grid cells according to their specific alignment rules (see Mineral Pieces section)
- Pieces can be rotated to any valid orientation (90°, 180°, 270°)
- Pieces must not overlap with each other
- Pieces must fit completely within the 10×8 grid

## Game Setup

1. **Choose Roles**: One player becomes the **Director**, all others become **Explorers**
2. **Set Difficulty**: Players agree on how many mineral pieces the Director will place (more pieces = higher difficulty)
3. **Director Placement**:
   - Director takes a screen and places it to hide their mine board
   - Director selects mineral pieces and places them on the 10×8 grid
   - Pieces can be rotated to any orientation
   - Pieces must align with grid cells
4. **Explorers Prepare**: Each explorer takes a solution sheet to track their deductions

## Gameplay

### Turn Order
- Play proceeds clockwise, starting with the player to the left of the Director
- **Players can make guesses even when it's not their turn!**

### Shooting Elastic Waves

On their turn, an explorer:

1. **Chooses an entry point** - Selects a number (1-18) or letter (A-R) from the grid edge
2. **Announces the shot** - "I'm shooting from position [X]"
3. **Director traces the wave path**:
   - Wave enters the grid horizontally or vertically from the chosen edge position
   - Wave travels in a straight line until it hits a mineral or exits the grid
   - When hitting a mineral, the wave:
     - **Bounces at a right angle** (90°) based on the mineral's edge orientation
     - **Changes color** based on the mineral type (see Color Mixing below)
   - Wave continues bouncing and changing colors until it exits or dissipates
4. **Director announces result**:
   - Exit position (number or letter)
   - Final color of the wave
5. **Explorer records**: Notes the entry point, exit point, and color on their solution sheet

### Wave Reflection Rules

Tangram pieces have edges at different angles based on their shape and rotation:

**Edge Types:**
- **45° diagonal edges** (on triangular pieces, rotated square)
- **180° straight edges** (horizontal/vertical edges on all pieces)

**Reflection Behavior:**
- **45° edges**: Wave bounces 90° perpendicular to its current direction
  - Example: Wave traveling downward (↓) hits 45° edge (/) → bounces right (→)
  - Example: Wave traveling right (→) hits 45° edge (/) → bounces upward (↑)
- **180° straight edges**: Wave bounces straight back (reverses direction)
  - Example: Wave traveling right (→) hits vertical edge (|) → bounces left (←)
  - Example: Wave traveling down (↓) hits horizontal edge (─) → bounces up (↑)

**Important Notes:**
- Reflection depends on which edge of the piece the wave hits
- The same piece can have different reflection behaviors depending on where the wave strikes it
- Piece orientation/rotation affects which edges are presented to the wave

### Wave Entry Points

When shooting from a numbered or lettered position:
- **Position "5" from top edge**: Wave enters at cell 5 (column 5) traveling downward
- **Position "11" from left edge**: Wave enters at row 1 (first row) traveling right
- **Position "E" from bottom edge**: Wave enters at cell 5 (column 5) traveling upward
- **Position "K" from right edge**: Wave enters at row 1 (first row) traveling left

The wave enters **at the cell position**, not between cells.

## Color Mixing System

The elastic wave starts as **white**. When it passes through or reflects off colored minerals, the colors mix according to these rules:

### Basic Color Changes
When a white wave hits a colored mineral, it takes that color:
- White + **Red** = Red
- White + **Blue** = Blue
- White + **Yellow** = Yellow

### Color Mixing (Additive)
When a wave reflects off multiple colored minerals:

- **Red + Blue** = Violet
- **Red + Yellow** = Orange
- **Blue + Yellow** = Green
- **Red + Blue + Yellow** = Black

### White Mineral Effect (Lightening)
When a colored wave hits a **white mineral**, the color becomes lighter:

- Red + **White** = Light Red (pastel)
- Blue + **White** = Light Blue (pastel)
- Yellow + **White** = Light Yellow (pastel)
- Violet + **White** = Light Violet (pastel)
- Orange + **White** = Light Orange (pastel)
- Green + **White** = Light Green (pastel)
- Black + **White** = White (completely lightened)

### Special Cases
- **Transparent mineral**: Reflects the wave without changing its color
- **White mineral**: Lightens the wave's color (makes it pastel)
- **Black (Petroleum)**: The wave is absorbed and dissipates - Director reports "no exit"

## Making a Guess

At any time (even on another player's turn), an explorer can:

1. Announce they want to make a guess
2. Mark on their solution sheet:
   - The position of each mineral piece
   - The color of each mineral piece
   - The orientation of each piece
3. The Director verifies the guess
4. If **completely correct** → That player **wins the game**!
5. If incorrect → Play continues (that explorer cannot guess again?)

**TODO - VERIFY:** What happens after a failed guess? Can they guess again?

## Winning the Game

The **first player to correctly identify the positions, colors, and orientations of ALL mineral pieces wins** the game.

## Strategy Tips

1. **Map the grid systematically** - Shoot waves from different angles to triangulate positions
2. **Track color changes** - Use color mixing clues to deduce which minerals are present
3. **Deduce shapes** - Different bounce patterns reveal different tangram shapes and orientations
4. **Count cells** - Keep track of how many cells are "occupied" based on wave behavior
5. **Use process of elimination** - Rule out impossible configurations

## Variants & Difficulty Adjustments

### Easy Mode
- Director places fewer pieces (e.g., 3-4 pieces)
- Use only one or two colors

### Standard Mode
- Director places 5-7 pieces
- Mix of different colors

### Hard Mode
- Director places all or most pieces (up to 14 pieces total if using 2 sets)
- Multiple colors including transparent pieces
- Can include symmetrical white pieces (note: original rules had issues with perfect symmetry - see Revised Rules)

## Known Issues & Revised Rules

The original game had a flaw when **two white/transparent tiles are placed in perfect symmetry**, which could make the puzzle unsolvable.

**Revised rulebooks** address this issue:
- BoardGameGeek has updated rulebook PDFs (2nd version)
- Check for "Orapa Mine Revised Rulebook" for the official fix
