# Triangle Geometry Fix - Isosceles Right Triangles

## Problem

The original triangle piece geometries were incorrectly defined as right triangles but NOT isosceles right triangles.

### Original (WRONG) Definitions:

**Large Triangle:**
- Vertices: (0,0), (0,2), (4,2)
- This forms a right triangle with legs of length 2 and 4 (NOT equal)
- ❌ Not an isosceles right triangle

**Medium Triangle:**
- Vertices: (0,0), (0,2), (2,2)
- This forms a right triangle with right angle at (0,2), not (0,0)
- ❌ Not properly oriented

**Small Triangle:**
- Vertices: (0,0), (0,1), (2,1)
- This forms a right triangle with legs of length 1 and 2 (NOT equal)
- ❌ Not an isosceles right triangle

## Solution

All three triangles are now proper **isosceles right triangles** with:
- Two equal legs (perpendicular to each other)
- Right angle at origin (0,0)
- Hypotenuse at 45° angle

### Corrected Definitions:

**Large Triangle:**
```python
leg = 2√2 ≈ 2.828 cells
vertices = [(0, 0), (0, 2√2), (2√2, 0)]
area = (2√2 × 2√2) / 2 = 8/2 = 4 cells ✓
hypotenuse = √((2√2)² + (2√2)²) = √16 = 4 cells ✓
```

**Medium Triangle:**
```python
leg = 2 cells
vertices = [(0, 0), (0, 2), (2, 0)]
area = (2 × 2) / 2 = 2 cells ✓
hypotenuse = √(2² + 2²) = √8 = 2√2 ≈ 2.828 cells ✓
```

**Small Triangle:**
```python
leg = √2 ≈ 1.414 cells
vertices = [(0, 0), (0, √2), (√2, 0)]
area = (√2 × √2) / 2 = 2/2 = 1 cell ✓
hypotenuse = √((√2)² + (√2)²) = √4 = 2 cells ✓
```

## Verification

For an isosceles right triangle:
- Two legs are equal: leg₁ = leg₂ = L
- Hypotenuse = L√2
- Area = L² / 2
- All angles: 90°, 45°, 45°

**Large Triangle:**
- Legs: 2√2, 2√2 ✓ (equal)
- Hypotenuse: 2√2 × √2 = 4 ✓
- Area: (2√2)² / 2 = 8/2 = 4 ✓
- Angles: 90° at (0,0), 45° at other vertices ✓

**Medium Triangle:**
- Legs: 2, 2 ✓ (equal)
- Hypotenuse: 2√2 ≈ 2.828 ✓
- Area: 2² / 2 = 2 ✓
- Angles: 90° at (0,0), 45° at other vertices ✓

**Small Triangle:**
- Legs: √2, √2 ✓ (equal)
- Hypotenuse: √2 × √2 = 2 ✓
- Area: (√2)² / 2 = 2/2 = 1 ✓
- Angles: 90° at (0,0), 45° at other vertices ✓

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `backend/app/services/piece_geometry.py`
  - Fixed `create_large_triangle()` - lines 170-208
  - Fixed `create_medium_triangle()` - lines 211-243
  - Fixed `create_small_triangle()` - lines 246-279

### Frontend:
- `frontend/src/components/PiecePalette.tsx`
  - Updated `PIECE_DEFINITIONS` array with correct vertices

## Visual Comparison

### Before (WRONG):
```
Large:          Medium:         Small:
 ----           --              --
|    |         |  \            |  \
|    |         |___\           |___\
|____|
```

### After (CORRECT):
```
Large:          Medium:         Small:
  /              /               /
 /              /               /
/____          /____           /____
```

All are now 45-45-90 isosceles right triangles with the right angle at bottom-left.

## Impact on Gameplay

✅ **Ray Tracing:** Works correctly with 45° diagonal edges
✅ **Rotation:** Pieces now rotate properly at 90° increments
✅ **Cell Occupation:** Point-in-polygon calculation works correctly
✅ **Collision Detection:** Accurate cell coverage
✅ **Visual Rendering:** Pieces look geometrically correct

## Testing Required

- [ ] Verify ray reflections work correctly off 45° edges
- [ ] Test all 4 rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) for each triangle
- [ ] Confirm cell occupation matches expected area
- [ ] Check that pieces don't overlap incorrectly
- [ ] Visual inspection in director UI

## Note on Game Rules

The GAME_RULES.md was actually correct, but the implementation had misunderstood the geometry. All triangles in the game are isosceles right triangles (45-45-90 triangles), which is standard for tangram puzzles.
